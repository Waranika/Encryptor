RSA Encryption Training Repository in Matlab
This repository contains code written by Elijah Ki-Zerbo for training on understanding RSA encryption using Matlab.

RSA encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that is used to secure sensitive data such as credit card numbers, login credentials, and other private information. Understanding how RSA encryption works and how to implement it is essential for cybersecurity professionals.

Contents
This repository contains the following Matlab scripts:

rsa.m: This file contains the implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm in Matlab.
keygen.m: This file contains the implementation of the key generation process for RSA encryption.
encrypt.m: This file contains the implementation of the encryption process for RSA encryption.
decrypt.m: This file contains the implementation of the decryption process for RSA encryption.
README.md: This file provides information about the repository and its contents.
Usage
To use the code in this repository, you should have a basic understanding of Matlab programming and cryptography.

To generate RSA keys, run the 'keygen.m' file:


'''keygen'''
This will generate a public key and a private key, which can be used for encryption and decryption.

To encrypt a message using RSA, run the 'encrypt.m' file:


'''encrypt'''
This will prompt you to enter a message to encrypt, and then encrypt the message using the public key generated by keygen.m.

To decrypt a message using RSA, run the 'decrypt.m' file:


'''decrypt'''
This will prompt you to enter a message to decrypt, and then decrypt the message using the private key generated by keygen.m.
