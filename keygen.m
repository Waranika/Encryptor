function [n, e, d] = keygen(p, q)
% RSA Key Generation
%
% This script generates the public and private keys for the RSA encryption
% algorithm. The keys are generated based on two prime numbers p and q, and
% the RSA algorithm parameters e and d are calculated according to the RSA
% key generation process.
%
% Usage:
%   [n, e, d] = keygen(p, q)
%
% Inputs:
%   p - a prime number
%   q - a prime number
%
% Outputs:
%   n - the modulus for the public and private keys
%   e - the public exponent for the public key
%   d - the private exponent for the private key
